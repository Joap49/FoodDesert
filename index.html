     <p>  "Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers." -American Nutrition Association</p>
     <p>  Many communities do not have access to fresh or organic foods. Too many people live closer to a McDonald's than a supermarket. Communities which are economically disadvantaged feel the effects of lack of supermarket and fresh foods far more than more privileged communities.</p>
